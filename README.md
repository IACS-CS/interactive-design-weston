## Task

Create an interactive, single-page website that teaches the user something through design and interactivity. You’ll build a small “explainer” experience where users choose reasons, explore states, or navigate through a concept — and the page responds with movement, reveals, and visual changes.

Think of it as a mix of:

- an infographic
- a guided decision tree
- a playful interface demo
- a tiny storytelling experience

Your teacher’s demo will be a site called “Should I Ride?”, but your topic will be completely your own.

---

## Why This Project?

Modern web design is rarely static. Designers build experiences where visuals change, cards reveal information, and users “poke” the interface to learn more. Even simple JavaScript can transform layout into behavior.

This project helps you explore:

- how to present information visually
- how to guide users through a story orecision
- how interactivity can clarify (or complicate!) a design
- how user actions change what they see

No frameworks. No libraries. Just HTML,SS, and a bit of vanilla JavaScript.

## A Note on AI

Generative AI tools can help you enormoly on this project, and I recommend you use tm wisely. Copilot is built into your Codeace editor and can be very helpful.
Note: If you use the AI within Codespac, I have provided a guide to it under ~/.giub/copilot-instructions.md If you want to e another AI to help, I recommend includi the prompt
I provide under AI.md as a prompt to he it help you.

When using AI, you should do your best  make sure you understand the concept of whatt is doing.

For this project, you may be on the verge of "vibe coding," where people with no coding experience can generate code that work. In this case, your goal is to make sure yu _can_ understand what the code generated doe and that you can explain it in your write-p, even if you didn't write it yourself. For tat reason, I recommend you use AI to geneate relatively small pieces of code at a tme and that you test and understand each piec one at a time, rather than simply having AI gnerate a whole page for you.

You may _not_ simply have AI do the enire project: you should be guiding the comuter to help you make your own vision come to ife, and you should be using your own eye as a esigner
to make sure the final product is somehing you are proud of.

## Required Components

### HTML Elements

Your project must include:

- A single webpage (index.html)
- At least one semantic heading (h1 orh2)
- Proper use of paragraphs (p)
- At least one image (img)
- At least one list (ul or ol)
- A citations page, which lists all sorces for images, icons, fonts, and information sed in your project (can be a separate HTML pge or a section at the bottom of your main pag) and includes a detailed description of how you created the project (tools, resources, process, including thorough and honest citation of AI use).

### Design Requirements

Your website must be:

- visually coherent and thematically consistent
- easy to navigate
- designed with clear fordances (users should know what’s clickable)

### JavaScript Interacvity

Your page must respondo user actions. Include all three:

1. A reveal or hide inraction  
   (showing a detail pel, toggling text, expanding a card)

2. A content-swap or vible state change  
   (switching which seion or mode is shown)

3. A visual indicator  progress, choice, or state  
   (wheel rotation, hilighted selection, progress bar, etc.)

## Honors Components (tional)

For Honors students, ilude at least two of the following:

- A custom hover or trsition animation
- An embedded multimed element (audio or video)
- Social sharing meta gs (Open Graph)
- A more complex JavaSipt interaction (multi-step logic, advanced class toggling)

---

## Project Ideas

Your interactive explaer could be about:

- a hobby or passion (sic genres, sneaker types, crochet tools)
- a guide (“Which SnacShould I Eat Right Now?”)
- a mood tracker (“Theour Moods of the Day”)
- a science explaier Why Leaves Change Color”)
- a decision helpe (“ich Study Technique Should I Use?”)
- a personal wheel(“Wch Version of Me Are You Talking To?”)

Pick something funor aningful — the better the fit, the better th design.

## Grading

You will receive *tworades**.

### 1. Published Wbsi (Design & Functio)

Evaluated using a ersn of the Digital Cntent Creation rubric, fcusing on:

- Content clarity nd gagement
- Interactivity (des  work? does it fee natural?)
- Visual design (cherce, readability, cnsistency)
- Correctness (clen sucture, valid HTMLCSS)
- Usability (intuiivesmooth navigation)
- Honors additions(ifpplicable)

### 2. In-Clrite- Understanding & eflection)

You will ansuestisthat demonstrateyour understandin

## Summary

This project blends **graphic desi**, *user experience**, and **JavaScript intactivity** into one interactive, single-page plainer. You’l build a website that teaches guides, or advises the user while expressing our own personality and visul style.

Your goal is to make something tha does’t just move — but something that moves th user _through_ an idea.

Make it fun.  
Make it yours.  
Make it interactive.
